\chapter{Web Applications}
\label{chp:webapps}

The third and final key part of this thesis project concerns the web applications that allow on the one hand to download and, for the municipality, upload Open Data, and on the other hand to visualize \acl{LOD} clearly through summary tables and graphs. The first web application is CKAN, and it is described in Section \ref{sec:ckan-webapp}. In this case, the work was to configure the open source portal CKAN, described in Section \ref{sec:ckan-webapp}, with the necessary plugins and extensions to follow the "Linee Guida Nazionali per la Valorizzazione del Patrimonio Informativo Pubblico".\footnote{\url{https://docs.italia.it/italia/daf/lg-patrimonio-pubblico/it/stabile}} The second web application, described in Section \ref{sec:datareports-webapp}, was built from scratch and is intended to retrieve data from the \ac{SPARQL} endpoint and display it graphically in the form of graphs, maps and tables.
