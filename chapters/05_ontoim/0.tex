\chapter{Description of the OntoIM Ontology}
\label{chp:ontoim-description}

The next two sections will describe more in details the \ac{OntoIM} ontology, designed to describe the semantic areas presented in Chapter \ref{chp:requirements}. In particular, Section \ref{sec:design-principles} presents the choices made in developing the ontology, while Section \ref{sec:area-by-area} will describe the main semantic areas and will present the principal classes in each of them.
