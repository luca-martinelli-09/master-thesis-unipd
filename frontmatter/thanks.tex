First, I would like to thank my parents, who have guided me and allowed me to get this far, supporting me both emotionally and financially throughout my growth.

I also want to thank my friends, who have always been by my side during these years, with whom I have shared unforgettable experiences, and who have put up with me even and especially during the most difficult times, and without whom I probably would not be the person I am now.

I would also like to thank Prof. Silvello, who believed in this project from the very beginning, and guided me to enable me to bring it to fruition.

Finally, a thought also goes out to the administration, the mayor, the aldermen, and the City of Sona officials, for their willingness, their help, and without whom this project would never have been possible.

To everyone, a heartfelt “Thank You”.
